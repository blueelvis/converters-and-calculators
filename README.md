And hopefully more!

# Why?
I am really tired with various online calculator sites and converter sites which have tons of ads, tons of useless features and always reach out to a server to do a calculation.
This is my attempt to create a purely static site(s) which can have various calculators and converters. Additionally, I want to keep try and ensure that there are 0 network calls to any 3rd party libraries.
This repo tracks my attempt to build all the calculators and converters using Cursor & generative AI!

This would also allow me to learn some UI/UX hopefully!
