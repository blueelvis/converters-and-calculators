# converters-and-calculators
A static site with fully offline experience, 0 ads and performant!


I am really tired with various online calculator sites and converter sites which have tons of ads, tons of useless features and always reach out to a server to do a calculation.
This is my attempt to create a purely static site(s) which can have various calculators and converters. This would also allow me to learn some UI/UX hopefully!

Currently planned converters -
1. AWS Cloudformation Template YAML <-> JSON
2. JSON Beautifier
3. ToUpper, ToLower, ToCamelCase, ToSnakeCase, Base64, SHA

Currently planned calculators -
1. IP Subnet Calculator (v4/v6)
2. Compound Interest Calculator


And hopefully more!
