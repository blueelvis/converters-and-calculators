# Backlog tracking
The backlog of this project is tracked over here - https://dev.azure.com/pranavjituri/Calculators%20And%20Converters


# converters-and-calculators
A static site with fully offline experience, 0 ads and performant!


I am really tired with various online calculator sites and converter sites which have tons of ads, tons of useless features and always reach out to a server to do a calculation.
This is my attempt to create a purely static site(s) which can have various calculators and converters. This would also allow me to learn some UI/UX hopefully!

Currently planned converters -
1. AWS Cloudformation Template YAML <-> JSON
2. JSON Beautifier
3. ToUpper, ToLower, ToCamelCase, ToSnakeCase, Base64, SHA

Currently planned calculators -
1. IP Subnet Calculator (v4/v6)
2. Compound Interest Calculator


And hopefully more!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
